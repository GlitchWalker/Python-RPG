# Python-RPG
My first Python game

As this is a more complex project, I'm going to start off more closely following the course than creating my own, umm, "tweaks" as I did for what was to become the Vulgar Calculator.

Instead, I'm going to start making bigger changes once I have finished it and have a working prototype.
